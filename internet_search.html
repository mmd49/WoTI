            <h2>What is a search engine?</h2>
            <p> Search engines are tools based on various websites that help users find and locate information and data on the Worldwide Web. Using multiple methods, a search engine could present the user with a list of some of the most popularly used sites within the search query. </p>
            <h2>The search for a Search engine</h2>
            <p>With the worldwide web continually gaining more websites with each passing week, it soon became somewhat troublesome for users of the internet to find the needed information. A person would look at a list after list of website names and hope for the one they needed. It all began at Stanford University, where two students,  Jerry Yang and David Filo, wanted to collect information for their Stanford fantasy basketball league. They first came up with a directory for web users to categorize websites tighter based on similar subjects. They would later call this directory Yahoo, for it is a snappy and unique name.  To generate a revenue source, they decided to advertise on their web page at the risk of alienating their users. However, it came out as a success as Yahoo had shown that it was possible to make money off the internet. Later would come Excite, a website similar to Yahoo except instead of a general list of the site the user would be looking for, Excite program would look through the world wide web-based on the keywords the user put in. Essentially this would become the foundation of a search engine.</p>
            <h2>The Rise of Google</h2>
            <p>Even though Yahoo, Excite, and other companies would slowly grow in popularity on the web, they still were not fully able to perfect the search engine. These sites would often turn irrelevant sites that would try to sell various products to users or contain “inappropriate” content. However,  a company named Google would be the one to fix this problem. In 1996, Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with a simple method to improve search on the internet.  By checking the number of links each website would have, the search engine could determine which sites were the most useful by other users. The search would become an immediate success on their campus, nearly bring the Stanford College internet to its knees.</p>
            <p>However, the be a problem with gaining money from search engines proved to be too unappealing to invest in, including Excite. They eventually got a few people to invest up to 12 million dollars towards Google. Instead of advertising directly on their site, the copy off of Bill Gross method of advertising is for their business plan.  By looking at the keywords typed up on a search engine, companies could gain a general image of the types of interests they have and things that they might be interested in buying.  Although Gross initially filed a lawsuit against Google, he was able to settle the matter in court. Once Google went on the public market, its shares snowballed from the hundred dollars to nearly seven hundred.</p>
            <h2> The Future of Google </h2>
            <p>Although Google has become one of the most profitable enterprises in the 21st century, it still strives to be as active and completive as it possibly can. Google has been investing in various websites and own personal projects to stay ahead in the game. Some of these projects were Google maps, Google docs, and Google mail that became extremely popular for many users. Still, Google shall always be best known for its useful search and how it changed advertising on the web.</p>
