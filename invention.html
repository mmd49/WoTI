            <h2>Beginning to the internet</h2>
            <p>The first general idea of communication via a network of computers dates back to J.C.R. Licklider in the 1950s, a professor of MIT, who believed that through computers, one would communicate information more efficiently than any other medium.  The main problem was that most computers were quite large,  expensive, and slow leaving many skeptical about the possible idea. However, in the 1950s, the Cold War between the U.S and the U.S.S.R had created a race for technical dominance. Thus, President Eisenhower created ARPPA to develop new spacefaring and computing technology. However, the space program was taken over by NASA later, so all computer development there halted. But a  graduate student at MIT named Leonard Klielock discovered that applying queuing theory to computers communication through a computer can be possible.</p>
            <p>With Queuing theory, data from the computer could gather at one node of the network to be transferred to another, allowing one to control the speed of which it traveled.  In the 1960s, out of fear of a nuclear attack, the United States government needed a communication network that could not be served if a nuclear strike were to destroy some cables. Paul Buran decided that using fishnet networks and “hot potato” routing on computers,  data could be chopped into small bit called packets and transferred from one node to the next one continuously.  </p>
            <h2>Timeshares and Terminals</h2>
            <p>In the 1960s, many computers were used for collecting information for timeshare through the use of terminals. The only problem was that one would need to log into a septate terminal at a different computer across the country. Bob Taylor of ARPPA thought it could be possible to connect these systems into a single network,  also known as resource sharing.  Seeing the potential to save time and resources with his revolutionary design, Bob was given a million dollars to create this computer network. By linking main terminals with a series of IMPs (Interface Message Processors) whose purpose was to translate and repurpose the data to the other terminals.  At the end of 1969, four site computers were interconnected with each other. With this development in technology came electrically sent mail (e-mail), one of the widely used internet applications.</p>
            <h2>A Network of networks</h2>
            <p>By design, the internet was created to be open-ended, allowing no one to have complete control over it and the flexibility to take on various tasks and information. By the 1970s, networks kept expanding and multiplying with local area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs). These networks eventually followed the TCP/IP Protocol to send their message packets back and forth through gateways.  This protocol would prevent several versions of the internet from being made instead of one interconnected network of networks.</p>
            <p>Then on June 9th, 1992, the internet was allowed into public use by congress, creating great commercial appeal. To let the average person have an easy time using the internet, a series of hyperlinks known as the worldwide web made and browser engines to support it. Netscape Navigator, one of the most famous early browsers, displayed text and images, becoming extremely user friendly. Now, pa the 21st century, the internet has taken many parts in our daily lives and actives. Form entertainment to business to research and development, the future seems to be a lot brighter thanks to the internet.</p>
